# Commit Convention Types

In any collaborative software development environment, maintaining a clean and understandable commit history is crucial. This documentation outlines the Commit Convention Types used in our project, based on the Conventional Commits specification. By adhering to these conventions, teams can ensure that their codebase remains well-organized and easy to navigate.

## Introduction to Commit Conventions

Commit conventions are a set of guidelines that standardize the way commit messages are structured. These conventions help developers understand the purpose of a commit at a glance and facilitate more effective collaboration across teams. Our project follows the Conventional Commits specification, which defines a specific format for commit messages.

<Info>Following a standardized commit message format helps in automating the release process and generating changelogs.</Info>

## Commit Message Format

The general format for commit messages is as follows:

```
type(scope): description
```

### Components of the Format

- **Type**: A required field that specifies the nature of the commit.
- **Scope**: An optional field that provides additional context about the area of the codebase affected.
- **Description**: A brief description of the changes made.

## Allowed Commit Types

Below is a comprehensive list of the allowed commit types in our project, along with examples for each.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Feature and Fix">

  | Type | Meaning | Example |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **feat** | A new feature | `feat(ui): add dark mode toggle` |
  | **fix** | A bug fix | `fix(auth): resolve login redirect loop` |

  <Tip>Use `feat` for new user-facing features and `fix` for bug resolutions.</Tip>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Code Maintenance">

  | Type | Meaning | Example |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **chore** | Maintenance/Config | `chore(deps): upgrade next-intl` |
  | **style** | UI/CSS changes (no logic) | `style(home): adjust hero padding` |
  | **refactor** | Code change (no feature/fix) | `refactor(utils): simplify date format` |
  | **test** | Adding or fixing tests | `test(auth): add unit tests for login` |

  <Info>These types are used for non-functional changes and maintenance tasks.</Info>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Performance and Build">

  | Type | Meaning | Example |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **perf** | Performance improvements | `perf(image): optimize logo loading` |
  | **build** | Build system/dependency updates | `build(npm): update lockfile` |

  <Warning>Ensure performance changes are measurable and beneficial.</Warning>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Documentation and CI/CD">

  | Type | Meaning | Example |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **docs** | Documentation only | `docs: update readme rules` |
  | **ci** | CI/CD changes | `ci: update vercel build settings` |

  <Note>Documentation updates are crucial for maintaining project clarity.</Note>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Miscellaneous">

  | Type | Meaning | Example |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **revert** | Reverting a previous commit | `revert: restore previous navbar layout` |
